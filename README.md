**Overview of the project**

**Project: Simple Calculator**
**Description**
A simple calculator application built using Tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.

**Features**
Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Ability to enter numbers and perform calculations
Clear last character and clear all functionality
Error handling for invalid input

**Usage**
Run the script using Python (e.g. python calculator.py)
A GUI window will appear with a text entry field and buttons for numbers 0-9
Enter numbers and perform calculations using the buttons
Use the "Clear" button to clear the last character entered
Use the "Clear All" button to clear the entire entry field
The calculator will display the result of the calculation in the entry field

**Code Structure**
The code is organized into a single class SimpleCalculator which contains all the functionality
The class has several methods:
  __init__: Initializes the calculator GUI
  update_entry_field: Updates the entry field with a new number
  clear_last_character: Clears the last character entered
  clear_all: Clears the entire entry field
  perform_calculation: Performs the calculation and displays the result
The code uses Tkinter's event-driven programming model, where button clicks trigger method calls

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included with Python)
